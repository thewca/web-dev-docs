# Accessing Database Backups

## Current - AWS Backups

Backups are stored in S3 as versions of the `cubing.sql` file. 

QUICK LINK: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/object/wca-backups?region=us-west-2&prefix=latest%2Fwca_db%2Fcubing.sql&tab=versions
1. Navigate to AWS console
2. S3 -> Buckets -> wca-backups -> latest
3. Toggle "Show versions" to see a version history, and download the one you need
4. Bear in mind that you can just grep this file for basic data - you don't always need to load it into a SQL client

When someone leaves the software team, they should be removed from all of the above.

# WCA Email Management

We use Google GSuite Groups for our mailing lists. This is way better than free Google Groups, because it gives us an API to automate group membership. It also saves us some hassle setting up redirects. Steps involved in creating a group:

1. Create the group on the GSuite admin panel. See how to [Create a group](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tFuNMyUcOwsYiGxN8OLG2w41AsLGZpKN-_5GcRGCr2g/edit)
2. Update [SyncMailingListsJob].(https://github.com/thewca/worldcubeassociation.org/blob/master/WcaOnRails/app/jobs/sync_mailing_lists_job.rb) if you want membership of the group to be automated. You can see an example of this in [PR 3803](https://github.com/thewca/worldcubeassociation.org/pull/3803).

# Dependabot PR's

For handling Dependabot PRs, we generally rely on our test suite. The exact procedure depends on the kind of update, but the tests are always the first and most important indicator for merging.

There is usually a changelog contained in the PR description, to help you decide whether to go ahead with the merge. For more concrete rules, refer to the listing below.

## Bugfix version bumps
For example, `1.1.3` --> `1.1.4` (last digit)

Merge these at will if the test suite checks out.

## Minor version bumps
For example, `6.0.4` --> `6.1.0` (middle digit)

Merge these at will if the test suite checks out.
Exception: If it's a crucial part of our infrastructure like `rails` or `typescript` or similar, keep an eye on the changelog.

## Major version bumps
For example, `3.2.1` --> `4.0.0` (first digit)

You should skim the changelog for any breaking changes that could be relevant.
If it's a crucial part of our infrastructure (see above), get a second pair of eyes to review.

# Removing Duplicate Motions

Motions are stored in an S3 bucket: 

Currently, motions are not deleted when a new set is deployed. We have to delete them manually, and clear the cache key.
1. Delete the old file 
    1. Navigate to: https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/wca-documents?region=us-west-2&bucketType=general&prefix=documents%2Fmotions%2F&showversions=false&tab=objects
    1. Select the file and select delete
    1. Confirm that you are targeting the correct file, and enter "permanently delete"
1. Clear the cache
    1. Connect to the production instance
    1. Enter the rails console with `bin/rails console`
    1. Find the cache key for the documents list with the following code:
    ```ruby
    Rails.cache.redis.with do |redis|
      cursor = "0"
      keys = []
      loop do
        cursor, batch = redis.scan(cursor)
        keys.concat(batch.select { |key| key.include?("documents") })
        break if cursor == "0"
      end
      keys
    end
    ```
    1. Optionally, run `rails.cache.read(cache_key_from_previous_command)` to confirm you are targeting the correct key
    1. Run `rails.cache.delete(cache_key_from_previous_command)`

## How are motions deployed?
